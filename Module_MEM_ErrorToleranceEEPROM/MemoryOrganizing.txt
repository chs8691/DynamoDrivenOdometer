Memory organization
===================

 - For every value one page (Ã  64 Byte) is used ( There are 4096  
   pages on the 24AA256)                                          
 - A value can be a data or a address (index)                     
 - A index address is a two Byte value (Word)                     
 - A data value is a 4 Byte value (unsigned int)                  
 - Highest Byte is written first, then second highest one etc.    
 - Every value will be written twice into a page-pair             
 - A value is valid, if both values of a pair are equal           
 - A data page will only be used for up to 1,000,000 (1E6) writes       
  (EEPROM limit of writes), max. value is 2^32 - 1 (unsigned long) 
 - Pages are organized in rooms: e.g. Develop, Test, Live et      
 - A room has following pages (as pairs):                         
    - Page 00..01 Index for data address                          
    - Page 02..03 data values between 0 .. 1E6 - 1                
    - Page 04..05 data values between 1E6 .. 2E6 - 1 etc.         

Durability and limits
=====================

Requirements / maximum values: 
- Every second one write access
- Maximum distance value = 200.000 km

Lifetime: 1 bank: 1E6 seconds -> 100 banks: 1,157 days runtime
	
EEPROM structure
================

The EEPROM's pages are grouped into three Parts with different number of pages.

      EEPROM ______________________________  
     | Unused  | Configuration | Room      |
	 | 0..99   | 100..199      | 200..4095 |
      -------------------------------------  

Unsed        : Free for for developing and test.
Configuration: For configuration values (wheel diameter etc.). (Later release)
Room         :  For distance ticks (In a later release uptime in seconds and distance values can be added)	  

Room
----	   

A page holds only one VALUE. The value can be an index or a data value. It is a unsigned long and will be stored in the first 4 Bytes of the page. The remaining Bytes 5 to 64 Bytes will be unused.
1 Page = 64 Byte

      Page __________________________________________________________
     |  Value _____________________________  Unused _______________  |
     | | Byte 0 | Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 3 | Byte 4 | .. | Byte 63 | |
     |  -----------------------------------------------------------  |
      ---------------------------------------------------------------

The value will be stored two times redundant in a PAIR. 
1 Pair = 2 Pages. 
   
      Pair ____________  
     | Page 1 | Page 2 | 
      -----------------  


A BANK has two pairs: one for the actual value and one for the previous one. Only the actual pair will be changed. The untouched one is for fallback. 
1 Bank = 4 Pages.
   
      Bank __________________________________
     |  Pair 0 __________ Pair 1 __________  |
	 | | Page 1 | Page 2 | Page 1 | Page 2 | |
     |  ----------------- -----------------	 |
      ---------------------------------------


The room has 974 banks ((4095 - 200) / 4) and holds index and values of the complete application. So we have 1 index bank and 973 data banks.
A index bank hold the number of the actual data bank (1 .. 973).
A data bank will be used to write the changed value for 1 million times (1E6). After that, the next bank has to be used. In sum we can write 973E6 times to the EEPROM. Values to
be stored are unsigned long values (0..4,294,967,295). If every second a value would be written, the max. lifetime is 31 years. If the distance would be stored in meters, the max. lifetime is 4,294,967 km. 

       Room ___________________________________________
      | Index bank | Data bank 1 | ... | Data bank 973 |
